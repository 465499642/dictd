.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B colorit
is a script for markuping text input and sending a result to pager (
.I less -r
by default) or stdout.
Markuping rules are described in a configuration file
which is filtered by preprocessor (the default is
.I m4
).
This script can be used for colorizing the text by
ANSI escape sequences, converting text to
.I html
or
.I dicf
formats or may be used as a pager instead of
.I less
by
.I dict
or many others. In particular, log files,
.I cc
or
.I diff
output can easily be colorized and viewed.
