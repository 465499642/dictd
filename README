This is ALPHA code.  This version is:
    ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/faith/dict/dictd-1.0b.tar.gz
but if something doesn't work, look for a later version.

Right now, there are few databases available for ftp, so the emphasis is on
testing the client.

The client defaults to looking at localhost and dict.org on port 2628.
Bret's server is on dict.miranda.org on port 2628.

This same request works fine on proteus.cs.unc.edu


The following

untar
./configure
make dict
make install.dict

should put dict in /usr/bin and dict.1 in /usr/man/man1

Then see the man page or use dict --help


NOTE: THIS CODE IS ALPHA.  It may dump core, it may print weird stuff.  If
it does, debug it or send a report to faith@cs.unc.edu.  But look for a new
version first.  If you can't handle alpha code, then WAIT until a more
robust release.
